# education-26h1-kr1

Project for **KR1: Documentation infrastructure for content discoverability** (VTEX Education, 2026H1).

## Purpose

Build the foundational documentation infrastructure that makes VTEX content AI-ready, machine-readable, and discoverable across channels.

## Project Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Start Date | Status | Purpose |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| **1: Testing** | 6 weeks | Feb 3, 2026 | In progress | Establish baseline measurement across all discovery paths |
| **2: Implementation** | 8 weeks | Mar 18, 2026 | Planned | Implement improvements based on baseline findings |
| **3: Validation** | 4 weeks | May 13, 2026 | Planned | Validate improvements with follow-up test runs |
| **4: Reporting & handoff** | 4 weeks | Jun 10, 2026 | Planned | Interpret results, create reports, present findings, and define next steps and guidelines |

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Testing (current)

**Duration:** 6 weeks (Feb 3–Mar 18, 2026)  
**Status:** In progress

Establish a repeatable way to measure search/knowledge-finding effectiveness across every path users use to find VTEX docs. Run a baseline so we can prioritise improvements and compare before/after.

**Key deliverables:** Test suite artifact (~20–32 issues with queries), path runners (4 paths: Google Search, Portal search, MCP, External LLMs), baseline report (pass rates per path, per persona, overall), and prioritised recommendations for improvements.

### Phase 2: Implementation (planned)

**Duration:** 8 weeks  
**Start:** Mar 18, 2026  
**Status:** Planned

Implement improvements to address gaps identified in Phase 1 baseline. Focus on highest-impact areas that improve discoverability across discovery paths. Improvements will likely include content structure and metadata enhancements, search infrastructure optimization, content discoverability improvements, MCP and AI agent optimization, and external search optimization.

### Phase 3: Validation (planned)

**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Start:** May 13, 2026  
**Status:** Planned

Validate that Phase 2 improvements have increased discoverability by re-running the test suite and comparing results to Phase 1 baseline. Analyze which improvements were most effective and identify any remaining gaps.

### Phase 4: Reporting & handoff (planned)

**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Start:** Jun 10, 2026  
**Status:** Planned

Interpret Phase 3 validation results, create comprehensive reports, present findings to stakeholders, and define next steps and guidelines for the team to continue improving content discoverability. Establish guidelines for maintaining and improving content discoverability going forward.
