# Education Team — 2026 KRs proposal

[Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGUuP0ps=/) 

**Mission:** We empower the VTEX ecosystem with the autonomy and confidence needed to maximize platform adoption and minimize operational friction.  
**Vision:** Education will be the knowledge infrastructure that powers the VTEX ecosystem, enabling AI agents to deliver instant guidance and humans to make better decisions.  
**Strategic areas:**

1) AI-powered support content dissemination  
2) Autonomous documentation generation

## Objectives

In 2026, we want to achieve:

1. Documentation is "AI-ready" and serves as the primary context for any agent building on VTEX (A)  
2. Documentation debt is stable or decreasing year over year (B)  
3. Documentation quality and coverage are enforced by design through AI-assisted workflows (B)  
4. Users find answers through AI-assisted search without navigating multiple sources (A)

In 2027, we want to achieve:

5. Documentation coverage gaps are automatically identified and prioritized through AI-assisted workflows (B)  
6. Business use cases are automatically discovered from user search patterns and interactions (B)  
7. Product feature status is automatically synced from engineering systems to documentation (B)  
8. Developers can instantly test and validate VTEX code examples via an MCP server (A)  
9. Users receive proactive content recommendations based on their role and journey stage (A)

## Key results

Documentation infrastructure for content discoverability (O1 \- A)  
*Champion: [Pedro Antunes Costa](mailto:pedro.costa@vtex.com.br)*

*Team: [Bárbara Celi](mailto:barbara.celi@vtex.com),[Isabella Veloso Sa](mailto:isabella.sa@vtex.com.br) e [Ricardo José Correia da Silva](mailto:ricardo.silva@vtex.com.br)*

Build the foundational documentation infrastructure that makes VTEX content AI-ready, machine-readable, and discoverable across channels. This ensures content can be effectively indexed, retrieved, and surfaced for relevant user intents, regardless of the entry point, whether through Google Search, portal search, AI agents, or MCP servers.

Run a production pilot for the AI assistant and define launch readiness (O4 \- A)   
*Champion: [Bruno Amui](mailto:bruno.amui@vtex.com.br)*

Deploy a controlled pilot of the AI assistant across the Help Center and Developer Portal to validate product-market fit, gather authentic user feedback, and establish clear launch-readiness criteria for a broader rollout.

### AI boilerplates for scalable documentation generation (O2/O3 \- B) *Champion: [Mariana Caetano](mailto:mariana.caetano@vtex.com.br)*

*Team: [Henrique Balbino](mailto:henrique.balbino@vtex.com.br), [Júlia Rabello](mailto:julia.alexandre@vtex.com.br) e [Karen Krieger](mailto:karen.krieger@vtex.com)*

Establish AI-fillable documentation templates that standardize content structure and quality requirements, enabling rapid, scalable content creation across different content types.
